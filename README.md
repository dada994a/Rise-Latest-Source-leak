# Rise Client Leak

## Overview
This repository contains leaked files for the Rise client. It appears that an unobfuscated version of the client was accidentally included in the latest release. Some obfuscation is still applied, but the files are released out of community.

## Background
According to dev, this issue is most likely due to Alan accidentally including the SCD files in the release package. It seems there was a bit of a mix-up.  
the_bi11iona1re suggests that this is probably just "yeah prolly just alan being a retard."

## Credits
Thanks to Alan for the mistake. This is your responsibility.

**Note**: If you have any issues, blame Alan, not us.  
You need to decompile the jar file yourself.

Also, we are not sure if it will work, but we have included some Files taken from an old source.

Enjoy!
